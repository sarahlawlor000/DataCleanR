Description: Provides a set of functions for inspecting and cleaning datasets 
    prior to analysis. The package supports identification of common
    data quality issues, including missing value patterns, outliers, duplicate
    rows, and column types. It also provides tools for standardising missing value
    representations, removing outliers using an interquartile range (IQR) rule,
    and running a simple end to end data cleaning pipeline. Cleaned data can be
    stored and printed using dedicated S3 classes and methods.
